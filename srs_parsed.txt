(Hire I.T. Specialists) 5 1. Introduction 1.1 Purpose H.I.T.S. (Hire I.T. Specialists) is a web-based platform designed to connect seniors needing in-home tech support with vetted Computer Science (CS) and Computer Information Technology (CIT) graduates. The H.I.T.S. (Hire I.T. Specialists) platform is designed to bridge the gap between seniors who need in-home tech support and vetted technology specialists (CS/CIT graduates) who can provide these services. Many seniors struggle with modern technology, including setting up devices, troubleshooting internet issues, and ensuring cybersecurity. Unfortunately, existing solutions are often expensive, impersonal, or limited to urban areas. H.I.T.S. offers a user-friendly, secure, and affordable way for seniors to access reliable tech support on demand. The platform enables clients to book tech specialists, manage appointments, and pay securely at a flat $50/hour rate. Specialists, in turn, can manage their availability, accept bookings, and showcase their credentials, creating a flexible and scalable freelance work environment. The primary goals of the H.I.T.S. platform include: • Convenience: A seamless booking system that connects seniors with local and background checked tech experts. • Affordability & Transparency: A flat-rate pricing model that eliminates unexpected costs. • Security & Trust: Secure payment integration and review-based specialist verification to build confidence. • Scalability & Expansion: The potential for future growth, including remote tech support and group training sessions. H.I.T.S. (Hire I.T. Specialists) 5 H.I.T.S. (Hire I.T. Specialists) 6 1.2 User Concepts: This platform supports three clearly defined user classes Clients (seniors or carers), Specialists, and Admins, each with distinct goals and permissions. The design follows a user-centered approach: requirements were gathered from seniors during interviews and refined through iterative prototypes. Core user concepts include: • Role-based mental models – every screen and action is scoped to what that role needs to accomplish. • Trust & safety cues – profile badges, background-check icons, and upfront pricing minimize perceived risk. • Progressive disclosure – advanced options (e.g., rescheduling, dispute filing) only appear when relevant, keeping primary flows simple. 1.3 User Experience (UX) UX encompasses the total impression the system leaves on a person—usefulness, ease, emotion, and value. For H.I.T.S. we targeted: • Clarity – plain language labels and a 12-point minimum font for older eyes. • Confidence – confirmation dialogs, real-time status updates, and a visible "Help" button reduce anxiety. • Efficiency – key tasks (finding a specialist, booking, paying) complete in ≤ 3 clicks or taps. UX was validated through hallway tests with five seniors (ages 56-72) and three specialists; feedback drove refinements such as larger calendar touch-targets and color-blind-safe status icons. H.I.T.S. (Hire I.T. Specialists) 6 H.I.T.S. (Hire I.T. Specialists) 7 1.4 User Interface (UI) The UI is built with a modern React + Tailwind front end that consumes a RESTful API. • Layout – a persistent top bar for identity & navigation; a left rail that collapses on mobile; a card-based content area. • Visual language – high-contrast palette that meets WCAG AA, 24-pixel buttons, and iconography from Lucid for consistency. • Components – reusable form controls, calendar picker, rating stars, and alert banners follow an atomic-design pattern, making the UI consistent and easy to extend. 1.5 Usability Usability was assessed against Nielsen’s heuristics and the CSUQ (Computer-System Usability Questionnaire). Findings: • Learnability – 100 % of test participants booked a session unassisted within 4 minutes on their first try. • Memorability – returning users averaged 60 % faster task completion. • Error prevention/recovery – inline validation prevents incomplete bookings; an "Undo" banner lets users reverse accidental cancellations for 30 seconds. 1.6 Principles of Navigation The application adopts a shallow-and-broad (horizontal) navigation scheme: • Global Nav – five primary icons (Dashboard, Book, Messages, Wallet, Help) visible always. H.I.T.S. (Hire I.T. Specialists) 7 H.I.T.S. (Hire I.T. Specialists) 8 • Contextual Tabs – within each primary area, tabs group related sub-tasks (e.g., Upcoming vs Past appointments). • Breadcrumbs & Back – help users orient themselves when deep-linking from emails/SMS. This structure minimizes clicks while preventing users from getting “lost.” 1.7 Storyboarding Early Storyboarding early in design we produced a seven-frame storyboard illustrating a typical client journey: 1. Mrs. Lee sees a "Tablet won’t turn on" prompt and opens the H.I.T.S. site. 2. She enters her ZIP code and views nearby specialists. 3. She taps George’s profile, reviews his badge and rate, and selects Tuesday at 10 a.m. 4. A cost summary appears; she confirms and pays. 5. The day before, an SMS reminder arrives. 6. George completes the visit; she rates him 5 stars. 7. She receives a follow-up email offering an optional subscription for future help. These frames informed the prototype’s main screens and ensured the narrative remained senior-friendly and cohesive. H.I.T.S. (Hire I.T. Specialists) 8 H.I.T.S. (Hire I.T.
